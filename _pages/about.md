Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Peng Cheng and Prof. Ruilong Deng. Now I'm a visiting student in SUTD (Singapore University Technology and Design) supervised by Prof.Jianying Zhou. I obtained my B.S. degree from Shandong University.

I am working on the security of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs), including the Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and the Internet of Things (IoTs), from both the process physics and control program.
